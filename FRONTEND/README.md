# PocketCluster Index Frontend w/ Scala.js

### How to setup and live debug  

1. Once you setup Scala.js with sbt, 

    ```sh
    $ sbt
    > run
    [info] Compiling 1 Scala source to (...)/scala-js-tutorial/target/scala-2.11/classes...
    [info] Running tutorial.webapp.TutorialApp
    Hello world!
    [success] (...)
    ```

2. Generate JavaScript

    To generate a single JavaScript file using sbt, just use the fastOptJS task:

    ```sh
    > fastOptJS
    [info] Fast optimizing (...)/scala-js-tutorial/target/scala-2.11/scala-js-tutorial-fastopt.js
    [success] (...)
    This will perform some fast optimizations and generate the target/scala-2.11/scala-js-tutorial-fastopt.js file containing the JavaScript code.
    ```

    Re-typing fastOptJS each time you change your source file is cumbersome. Luckily sbt is able to watch your files and recompile as needed:
    
    ```sh
    > ~fastOptJS
    [success] (...)
    1. Waiting for source changes... (press enter to interrupt)
    From this point in the tutorial we assume you have an sbt with this command running, so we donâ€™t need to bother with rebuilding each time.
    ```
