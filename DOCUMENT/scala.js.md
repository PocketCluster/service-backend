# PocketCluster Index Frontend w/ Scala.js

**Various Tips (09/12/2016)** 

1. `@JSExport` could be used to replace inline JS function  
2. `scala.scalajs.js.JSConverters.JSRichGenMap` package to required to convert `JSDictionary` <-> `Map`  
For more about Interoperability between `JS` and `Scala` take a look at [Interoperability](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/interoperability/) and [Scala.js](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js)
3. Using `Future`, XHR connection could be more succinct.
4. `JSDictionary` to `Map` has some issues. Use following snippet to catch exceptions.

  ```scala
  try {
  } catch {
      case e:Exception => e.printStackTrace
  }
  ```
5. Interop between infinite scroll and Mansory might be possible in the future?

**How to setup and live debug (09/07/2016)** 

1. Once you setup Scala.js with sbt, 

    ```sh
    $ sbt
    > run
    [info] Compiling 1 Scala source to (...)/scala-js-tutorial/target/scala-2.11/classes...
    [info] Running tutorial.webapp.TutorialApp
    Hello world!
    [success] (...)
    ```

2. Generate JavaScript

    To generate a single JavaScript file using sbt, just use the fastOptJS task:

    ```sh
    > fastOptJS
    [info] Fast optimizing (...)/scala-js-tutorial/target/scala-2.11/scala-js-tutorial-fastopt.js
    [success] (...)
    This will perform some fast optimizations and generate the target/scala-2.11/scala-js-tutorial-fastopt.js file containing the JavaScript code.
    ```

    Re-typing fastOptJS each time you change your source file is cumbersome. Luckily sbt is able to watch your files and recompile as needed:
    
    ```sh
    > ~fastOptJS
    [success] (...)
    1. Waiting for source changes... (press enter to interrupt)
    From this point in the tutorial we assume you have an sbt with this command running, so we donâ€™t need to bother with rebuilding each time.
    ```
